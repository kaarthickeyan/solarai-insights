          One of the key advancements planned for this project is the integration
           of a solar panel lifespan prediction feature. By analyzing deviations in 
           energy output compared to historical maximum performance under similar conditions, 
           the system can predict potential panel degradation. This will help in proactive maintenance 
           and improve the overall longevity and efficiency of solar installations.
